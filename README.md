# BookStore Front-end
https://bookstore--front-end.vercel.app/

BookStore is a website I'm developing that simulates buying and selling books. 
This repository is for the front-end of the website, in which the main technologies used are: React, Next.js, TypeScript, NextAuth.js, React Hook Form and Yup.
